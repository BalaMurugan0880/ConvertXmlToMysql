<strong>Kuala Lumpur, 19 September 2017</strong> – Little Book BIG Secrets writer Rachel Siew Suet Li did not let adversity constrain her in her quest to become an author.

With the publication fully funded by the MIRM as well as the book launch being hosted by Microsoft Malaysia, Rachel Siew unveiled her new LinkedIn account featuring her book in the publication section. Through her account, LinkedIn users will be able to communicate with Rachel directly, sharing experiences in bringing out the best plus empowering oneself with endless possibilities.

Little Book BIG Secrets is a light-hearted yet touching book that illustrates Rachel’s wit, determination and resilience. It is about the everyday challenges faced by Rachel, whose journey was determined even before she first saw the light of day. Her inspirational quotes in the face of her many challenges will help readers approach life with a positive energy and fresh perspective.

“In this book, there are three significant points which reinforces my principles, which is to Inspire, to Motivate and to Empower. It is my hope to motivate and encourage other families who are in somewhat of a similar situation as mine. This may seem like a very difficult and winding journey ahead, but we can still make a difference in our lives,” said Rachel.
